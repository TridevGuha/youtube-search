search using youtube api with javascript

#error

in chrome console:
Failed to execute 'postMessage' on 'DOMWindow': The target origin provided ('file://') does not match the recipient window's origin ('null')

in firefox console no error but the page is still blank

the error is same with or without using apache http webserver(or any other)

any fix is appreciated.
